This is my **first blog post** using Astro. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## What I'll be writing about

- Web Development
- Programming tutorials
- Tech news and insights
- Personal projects

## Why Astro?

Astro is an amazing framework because:

1. It's fast by default
2. Ships zero JavaScript unless needed
3. Supports multiple frameworks
4. Great for content-focused websites

```javascript
// Here's some code
const greeting = "Hello, Astro!";
console.log(greeting);
